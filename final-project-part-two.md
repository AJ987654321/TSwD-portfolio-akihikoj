# User research 
The questionnaire for user research is as follows.
1. Have you understood what question this page would like to answer?
2. Have you figured out the answer to the question?
3. Was the storyline fluent for you? (if the answer is No, please explain what needs to be improved.)
4. If you're presenting this slides to the baseball team owner (potential audience), what element do you need additioanlly?
5. Please describe anything else to be improved if any.

## Interview findings


| Questions               | Interview 1 (briefly describe) | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Have you understood what question this page would like to answer? | The problem statement was straightforward and easy to understand because it was both a simple and clear question based on familiar concerns. |Maybe. At first, I couldn't becuase I'm not familiar with the topic but later I could understand!|Yes. This page tries to show which offensive or defensive team is stronger.|
|Have you figured out the answer to the question?|t was easy to understand. If I were to make one suggestion, it would be to display the answer to the question in a larger font, like a title, for better visibility.|Yes. I'm not familar with this topic, but the data says that offensive is likely to win.|Yes. Answer can be found visually.|
|Was the storyline fluent for you? (if the answer is No, please explain what needs to be improved.)|It was easy to understand. If I were to make a suggestion, the conclusion could be improved by incorporating storytelling to explain why teams with higher offensive power tend to have higher win rates. For example, a narrative could describe how scoring a large number of runs exhausts the opposing team's relief pitchers, giving teams with strong offensive capabilities an advantage.|Yes. You explain the rules of the game and it is clear + data tells me a understanding. |Yes. Storyline looks fluent for me. It was easy to understand what baseball is, which countries have national league, research approach, visualization and etc.|
|If you're presenting this slides to the baseball team owner (potential audience), what element do you need additioanlly?|1.The batting order of the team.<br>2.The composition of the team's offensive power (which players should be traded).|If the team owner is not familiar with the graph, I'd like to show the number of % or take a clearer look for better understanding|History of strategy.Probably, baseball strategy history might be effective. In football/soccer, the strategy has been changing, I assume that baseball has similar change. If recent strategy looks offensive, it will be more persuasive.|
|Please describe anything else to be improved if any.|1. Is the interpretation that Puerto Rico belongs to North America based on a political meaning or a geographical one? While I am not familiar with the precise definition, intuitively, I thought it was a country that belongs to Latin America. |1. I'd like to suggest making the same score number on the x-axis and y-axis to make it clearer. |These are very minor suggestions...<br>
1. I can see agenda of this page at the top. It doesn't have number. But, the storyline has the number. It looks that the agenda at top was picked as important chapters. Therefore, the number in each chapter would not be required ?|
|| 2. In *Selection of National Leagues for Research*, it would be better to retain the original colors rather than turning all selected countries red, as this would enhance the intuitive understanding that countries were selected from various regions. |2. I'd like to suggest a separate line before the seven further steps to emphsize the things you want to say. Maybe you can use navy background as section 4. research approaches. but overall it's really awesome! |2. Probably, chapters might be better using different format or highlight with other colors ? For example, I recognized *H* rather than the chapter in right case. If thc chapter is more recognizable, I would know which chapter I am at.|
|| 3. There is a representation with red circles placed on a world map depicted in paint colors, but the combination of brown and red makes it somewhat difficult to see. Using green, blue, or yellow would be more effective. | ||
|| 4. Among the three photos displayed in *3. Know the Baseball*, the second photo quickly disappears when scrolling. To address this, the scrollable area for the second photo should be made wider. |||
||5. For WHIP and BA, pairing them with specific player profiles and their abilities (e.g., numerical scores displayed in a game) would enhance intuitive understanding. |||
||6. The graph in *Which is Stronger, Offensive or Defensive? (MLB)* should be displayed using the full width of the screen. |||
||7. The graphs of Defensive and Offensive scores for each country are of different sizes compared to the Combined graph. Standardizing their sizes would improve consistency. |||
|| 8. Adding a brief comment below each countryâ€™s Defensive and Offensive score graph to highlight its key features would make the graphs easier to understand when viewed. |||
|| 9. The section titled *5. Setting Up Hypothesis* includes information other than the actual hypotheses (e.g., Visualization Model and Area Explanation). These should be organized into separate sections. |||

| Show the answer more clearly in the conclusion section | I will change the section's layout for the conclusion so that every audience can cleary understand the conclusion. |
|Add the followings for audience's better understanding.<br> 1.The batting order of the team.<br>2.The composition of the team's offensive power (which players should be traded)|I will add them into further steps.|
| In the leagues selection, the coloring is hard to understand because of the com bination of the colors |I will change the colors to enhance the visibility.|
|Transition of photos in 'Know the baseball' section harms the eye tracking because of its lack of fluency.|I will chnage the way of transition of photos not to harm eye tracking.|
|Technical term explanation requies the examples to understand quick|I will create imaginary player's card which represents the stats.|
|Graphs of the results should be displayed the same width of screen|I will make them bigger for more visibility|
|Graphs scale should be the same across the graphs.|I will standardize the scale of the graphs.|
|Brief comments on each country's result is nice to have|I will add them.|
|Hypothesis section includes not only hypothesis but the models explanation|In practicing, this doesn't flow smoothly. I will reorganize this.|
|To use navy background for chapter 4.|I willchange the background color for more visibility.|
|Conclusion section needs to be more highlighted utilizing separator|I will reorganize the section of conclusion and completely separate the further steps.|
