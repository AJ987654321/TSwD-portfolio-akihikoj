## Interview findings


| Questions               | Interview 1 (briefly describe) | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Have you understood what question this page would like to answer? | The problem statement was straightforward and easy to understand because it was both a simple and clear question based on familiar concerns. |             |             |
|Have you figured out the answer to the question?|t was easy to understand. If I were to make one suggestion, it would be to display the answer to the question in a larger font, like a title, for better visibility.|             |             |
|Was the storyline fluent for you? (if the answer is No, please explain what needs to be improved.)|It was easy to understand. If I were to make a suggestion, the conclusion could be improved by incorporating storytelling to explain why teams with higher offensive power tend to have higher win rates. For example, a narrative could describe how scoring a large number of runs exhausts the opposing team's relief pitchers, giving teams with strong offensive capabilities an advantage.|             |             |
|If you're presenting this slides to the baseball team owner (potential audience), what element do you need additioanlly?|1.The batting order of the team.<br>2.The composition of the team's offensive power (which players should be traded).|||
|Please describe anything else to be improved if any.|1. Is the interpretation that Puerto Rico belongs to North America based on a political meaning or a geographical one? While I am not familiar with the precise definition, intuitively, I thought it was a country that belongs to Latin America. |||
|| 2. In *Selection of National Leagues for Research*, it would be better to retain the original colors rather than turning all selected countries red, as this would enhance the intuitive understanding that countries were selected from various regions. |||
|| 3. There is a representation with red circles placed on a world map depicted in paint colors, but the combination of brown and red makes it somewhat difficult to see. Using green, blue, or yellow would be more effective. |||
|| 4. Among the three photos displayed in *3. Know the Baseball*, the second photo quickly disappears when scrolling. To address this, the scrollable area for the second photo should be made wider. |||
||5. For WHIP and BA, pairing them with specific player profiles and their abilities (e.g., numerical scores displayed in a game) would enhance intuitive understanding. |||
||6. The graph in *Which is Stronger, Offensive or Defensive? (MLB)* should be displayed using the full width of the screen. |||
||7. The graphs of Defensive and Offensive scores for each country are of different sizes compared to the Combined graph. Standardizing their sizes would improve consistency. |||
|| 8. Adding a brief comment below each country’s Defensive and Offensive score graph to highlight its key features would make the graphs easier to understand when viewed. |||
|| 9. The section titled *5. Setting Up Hypothesis* includes information other than the actual hypotheses (e.g., Visualization Model and Area Explanation). These should be organized into separate sections. |||



# Identified changes for Part III


| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Show the answer more clearly in the conclusion section | I will change the section's layout for the conclusion so that every audience can cleary understand the conclusion. |
|Add the followings for audience's better understanding.<br> 1.The batting order of the team.<br>2.The composition of the team's offensive power (which players should be traded)|I will add them into further steps.|
| In the leagues selection, the coloring is hard to understand because of the com bination of the colors |I will change the colors to enhance the visibility.|
|Transition of photos in 'Know the baseball' section harms the eye tracking because of its lack of fluency.|I will chnage the way of transition of photos not to harm eye tracking.|
|Technical term explanation requies the examples to understand quick|I will create imaginary player's card which represents the stats.|
|Graphs of the results should be displayed the same width of screen|I will make them bigger for more visibility|
|Brief comments on each country's result is nice to have|I will add them.|
|Hypothesis section includes not only hypothesis but the models explanation|In practicing, this doesn't flow smoothly. I will reorganize this.|
