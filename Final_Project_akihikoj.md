## Final Project

Here are the deliverables of AJ's Final Project

# Outline
I have been watching baseball games, and I love offensive teams.
However, commonly being said, the offensive team can't win the championship.
I'm wondering if it's true because my favorite team in Japan wins a championship this year whereas it was super offensive and super defenseless.
Another thing is whether the importance of offense and deffense varies across the leagues, season and playoffs.
