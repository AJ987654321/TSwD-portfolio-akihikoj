## Final Project

Here are the deliverables of AJ's Final Project

# Outline
I have been a BIG FAN of baseball. <br>
Though I have only been watching the sport for 15 years, one question has always intrigued me: Which is stronger, an offensive team or a defensive team?<br>
The team I support is known for being highly offensive, yet they had struggled to win for many years. <br>
However, this year, they finally won the championship. Interestingly, in the United States, the Los Angeles Dodgers—another offensively dominant team—also won the championship this year. <br>
This coincidence might not be purely by chance.<br>

To find an answer to this longstanding question, I believe it's essential to move beyond the assumption that American baseball is the best in the world and instead compare multiple leagues. <br>
For this analysis, I will focus on data from the past 10 years of Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States, Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) in Japan, and the Mexican League in Mexico.<br>

By analyzing these datasets, I aim to determine whether offensive or defensive teams tend to be stronger. Through this exploration, I hope to uncover insights into this fascinating question. <br>
