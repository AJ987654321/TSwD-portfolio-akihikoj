# The final data story
I have created the final project in the storyline below.<br>
First, I thought I would like to answer the question: Which team is stronger in baseball: Offensive or Defensive?<br>
To answer this question, I began by considering how to define "Offense" and "Defense" in baseball. I selected several representative offensive and defensive stats. However, since comparing stats across different seasons or leagues is not feasible, I defined a score by setting the average stats for each specific season and league as zero and measuring how many standard deviations a particular stat deviates from the mean.<br>
Next, to decide which leagues to include, I gathered information on National Leagues worldwide. I plotted these leagues on a world map by region and number of teams. From this, I chose the leagues with the most teams from three regions—North America, Central and South America, and Asia—selecting the U.S., Mexico, and Japan. To clarify the selection, I highlighted the chosen leagues in red.<br>
For the scores, I created a scatter plot with Offense on the X-axis and Defense on the Y-axis, representing winning percentages with a gradient from blue to red. To make the flow to the conclusion clear, I structured the analysis as a hypothesis test, illustrating the hypothesis that strong defense would lead to success before progressing to the conclusion.
On the other hand, feedback suggested that explanations about baseball might be necessary for audiences unfamiliar with the sport. (Although the intended audience is primarily baseball team owners, making this situation unlikely.) In response, I added a section explaining baseball-related concepts before proceeding with the actual analysis.
Feedback also pointed out that the steps for data organization and hypothesis testing were not sufficiently highlighted. To address this, I restructured the page layout to explain everything visually, resulting in its current form. Furthermore, since this analysis only concludes that Offense should be prioritized based on simple statistical analysis, I added a section on "Further Steps" to explore what strengthening offense entails.<br>


# Changes made since Part II
What I have changed from Part 2 are mainly categorized into 2 parts: Refinement of Storyline and Enhancement of Visibility.
| Research synthesis                       |Category | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Show the answer more clearly in the conclusion section |Enhancement of Visibility|I have highlighted the conclusion.|
|Add the followings for audience's better understanding.<br> 1.The batting order of the team.<br>2.The composition of the team's offensive power (which players should be traded)|Refinement of Storyline.|As further steps, I have added the section to dig into the details of how team can be more offensive.|
| In the leagues selection, the coloring is hard to understand because of the com bination of the colors |Enhancement of Visibility|I have changed the color to white for better visibility.|
|Transition of photos in 'Know the baseball' section harms the eye tracking because of its lack of fluency.|Enhancement of Visibility|Delete the photos to prevent any noise of eye-catching.|
|Technical term explanation requies the examples to understand quick|Enhancement of Visibility|I have created the imaginary player and team's stats in order to show an example.|
|Graphs of the results should be displayed the same width of screen|Enhancement of Visibility|I have changed the size of graph of Combined|
|Graphs scale should be the same across the graphs.|Enhancement of Visibility|I have standardized the size of chart acrsoss the leagues.|
|Brief comments on each country's result is nice to have|Refinement of Storyline|I have added the comments on each league for readers to understand the features of the leagues.|
|Hypothesis section includes not only hypothesis but the models explanation|Refinement of Storyline|I have restructured the storyline. Data Research, Data Interpretation, Setting up Hypothesis are the new sections to follow the storyline.|
|The result summary is not obvious to the audience|Refinement of Storyline|I have added the comparison of hypothesis outcome and simplified result in conclusion section to clearly show how the result and hypothesis are different.|
||Refinement of Storyline|In the practice of presentation, the flow of storyline from data research to setting hypothesis was not fluent, therefore I have restructured the structure of the shorthand webpage.|


## The audience
The baseball teams owners are the assumed audience. In the presentation, this story only reached at an initial conclusion that offense is important.<br>
At the end of the story, the way to improve offnesiveness and defensivess is still not clear.
As further steps, I have added soe areas where I am dig into to figure out how offesnivenss can be improved.
