# Portfolio
Thank you for visiting!
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 


# About me
Hi, this is Akihiko Jo in MISM 16, and please call me AJ, because my full name is sometimes difficult to pronounce. I'm from Japan, and I have been working
for financial institutions for 15 years mainly as a project manager. I anticipate to obtain the skills from this course
to efficiently show the data to the executives in my company.
I am a father of 3 years old daughter, and my hobby now is to bring my daughter to the national parks in the United States.

# What I hope to learn
In our past career, it was always practical, and no educational backgroud about technologies. Therefore, we weould like to learn the points below for my future career: 

1. Technical Background<br>
   I aim to develop IT skills, including coding, which I have not studied systematically before. My goal is to acquire the skills
   necessary to make informed decisions when I eventually move into a management role.
2. Strategical Skills<br>
   I want to learn how to use technology in alignment with a company’s vision, enabling me to make decisions that reflect this vision.
   I’m interested in understanding how to incorporate the vision into daily activities and make sound strategic decisions
   in a volatile market environment.
3. Soft Skills<br>
   I want to develop knowledge in negotiation and conflict resolution,
   essential for implementing the decisions I make. This will equip me with the capability to execute my decisions effectively.
