# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me.

# About me
Hi, this is Akihiko Jo in MISM 16, and please call me AJ, because my full name is sometimes difficult to pronounce. I'm from Japan, and I have been working
for financial institutions for 15 years mainly as a project manager. I anticipate to obtain the skills from this course
to efficiently show the data to the executives in my company.
I am a father of 3 years old daughter, and my hobby now is to bring my daughter to the national parks in the United States.

# What I hope to learn
In our past career, it was always practical, and no educational backgroud about technologies. Therefore, we weould like to learn the points below for my future career: 

1. Technical Background<br>
   I aim to develop IT skills, including coding, which I have not studied systematically before. My goal is to acquire the skills
   necessary to make informed decisions when I eventually move into a management role.
2. Strategical Skills<br>
   I want to learn how to use technology in alignment with a company’s vision, enabling me to make decisions that reflect this vision.
   I’m interested in understanding how to incorporate the vision into daily activities and make sound strategic decisions
   in a volatile market environment.
3. Soft Skills<br>
   I want to develop knowledge in negotiation and conflict resolution,
   essential for implementing the decisions I make. This will equip me with the capability to execute my decisions effectively.

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.  

![funny dog picture](funny-dog-unsplash.jpg)

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.  

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
